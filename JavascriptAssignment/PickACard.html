<h3>The Queen of Hearts</h3></br>

The Queen is a playing card with a picture of a queen on it. </br>
The usual rank of a queen is as if it were 12 (or 13), that is, between the King and the Jack, or Knight.</br>
In the standard English playing card deck, legend states the Queen of Hearts is a representation of Elizabeth of York, </br>
queen consort of Henry VII of England. Certainly the headdress the queen wears under her crown is of the Early Tudor era. </br>

<h3>The Ace of Spades</h3></br>
The original fame of the Ace of Spades came because in games like Poker, where you can assign a value to a suit so that you know which hand beats which if there are duplicates,</br>
the Spades were considered the highest suit. The Ace, though originally the lowest card in value, was switched to the highest value in many decks. Some have used the example </br>
that the Ace represents God, and thus the high card. Others have claimed that the Ace represents the people, the peasantry, and during the French Revolution it became a popular </br>
notion to show the revolt by placing the Ace as the high card over the royalty.</br>

<h3>The Joker</h3></br>

The Joker is a unique playing card found in most modern card decks, as an addition to the standard 52 cards of four suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades). </br>
The often colorful card has a rich history, and varying interpretations depending on specific card games and their rules.</br>
